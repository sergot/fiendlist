## TODO:

- [ ] Warning on trying to log out when logged in as anonymous user (they will lose their session)
- [ ] Fix printing lists being only a member (not owner) of a list
- [ ] Fix join a list form, it should contain a character name input just like the create list form - it should also veirfy that character in tibiadata api
- [ ] Add a character detail page where we list all the unlocked soulcores
- [ ] Implement a suggestion system for soulcores - on character detail view, the application will suggest soulcores to add to the character as unlocked based on activity on lists they are a member of
- [ ] Join list view should check if the user exists in tibiadata api
